# Critique By Design

I wasn't specifically on the lookout for a music-related visualization, but when I stumbled upon one, I wasn't complaining! 
Pulled from a [study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253915/favorite-music-genres-in-the-us/) published by Music Business Association in 2018, the visualization describes preferred music genres of 3000 U.S. consumers by age group. I was excited to work with the visualization because—as a drummer who enjoys playing several music genres—its data was immediately interesting. More importantly though, I was able to quickly identify areas of the viz. that I liked and disliked. This helped me build a strong [Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) (developed by Stephen Few), which guided my wireframing process and my eventual redesign.

## The OG Viz
This is the original visualization that I chose to work on:

## Critiquing Cogently
After a good, prolonged look at the visualization, I recorded my general thoughts about it:

*"At first glance, the visualization looks interesting.*

*The colors are attractive. I especially like how the yellow and purple look towards the top of each stacked bar. The color wheel and its complementary colors substantiate why this may have been appealing. Beyond the scatter of colors that I immediately notice, I find myself being drawn to the chart because I’m a music enthusiast. I am in their target audience, and so I naturally want to learn more about how genres are perceived by different age groups. Perhaps, however, this may not be the case for everyone.* 

*Within seconds, there is a growing sense of feeling lost. While the visualization doesn’t feel jarring or irritating to look at, it still places too little consideration on the overall aesthetic appeal. The colors, percentages and legend all begin to swim around after a moment. I want to understand what numbers are being shown to me, but am unable to do it without some hard, focused searching. I feel like a visualization should make it easy for viewers to grasp interesting data, not hard. As a result, the information is interesting only for the short term—the short term being a couple of seconds. It doesn’t leave a lasting impression. I don’t feel like I learned something extraordinary. Perhaps, however, that is in part the topic’s fault, not solely the visualization’s. That is, the information doesn’t move me. I don’t find new purpose after viewing the chart. I don’t even feel compelled to simply share this information with more people.* 

*There are, however, things that I do like. I like that the visualization is credible and accurate. The study was conducted by Audiencenet and published by Music Business Association. It surveys favorite music genres of 3000 consumers in the United States as of July 2018, sorted by age group. This data is explained well in their provided Excel file, which also offers references and research methodology. This offers pretty good context, though the visualization doesn’t rely on it to be understandable – which is really great. The charts don’t show too much complex information. While this information is presented in a more complex way than needed, at least not a single element feels inscrutable. I also like that the goals of the visualization are clear, and the graph conveys exactly what it aims to. The visualization feels complete, apart from the fact that it does not include an “Other” response, raising the question: is every respondent’s answer represented or were some left out?* 

*If I could change a few things, I would begin with the colors. They bring out the notorious rainbow effect that we’ve frequently discussed in class. The percentages on the y-axis are also a little confusing; why do the numbers go beyond 300%? That takes a little more thinking, since it isn’t instantly intuitive. A final observation is that the comparisons between the age groups are unevenly distributed, so I would consider normalizing those as well."*

**Critiquing the Critique**
I really enjoyed Stephen Few's evaluation method. It went beyond the Good Charts method in helping me consider pieces I wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. Completeness and usefulness to the audience are two such components. I wouldn’t have naturally articulated these in my critiques. I also liked that the scale was  from 1-10, and not from 1-5. This pushed me to think more critically about the rankings I picked under each metric. I would also rank the ease of completing this evaluation highly. The questions asked were simple, well-explained and interesting. 

Something I would add to this evaluation method is “Emotional Appeal.” This is closely related to “Engagement,” but is more spontaneous. For example, some visualizations are instantly pleasing while some can be instantly frustrating. I think these immediate, visceral reactions are useful to record because they capture first impressions… and, often, first impressions really last! 

I might even add a “How Much Time Did It Take For You To Fully Understand The Visualization?” metric. I think people tend to record higher scores under “Intuitiveness” (which captures how easy a visualization is to understand) because it gives them either a greater sense of achievement or a greater sense of leniency. That is, I feel like we are prone to remarking that a graph is easier to understand than it actually is because of an unconscious bias within us to demonstrate we’re:
(i) smart or 
(ii) forgiving of smaller flaws as long as the overall message is understood. 
Essentially, if I were asked whether a graph was intuitive or not, I would likely say yes unless there was a very strong reason to convince me otherwise. Similarly, if this binary question were expanded to a scale from 1 to 10, I would still lean towards numbers beyond 5 because going below that would be equivalent to saying, “no.” Unless there was a strong reason to convince me otherwise, I would most probably rank a graph above average (>5) on intuitiveness. 
To solve this problem, it might help to reframe the question to “how much time did it take you to fully understand this?” I think we’d get more honest responses because we’re forced to come up with a number of our own. We aren’t just settling for one of the options provided.
