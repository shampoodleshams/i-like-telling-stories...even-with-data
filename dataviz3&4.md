# Critique By Design

I wasn't specifically on the lookout for a music-related visualization, but when I stumbled upon one, I wasn't complaining! 
Pulled from a [study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253915/favorite-music-genres-in-the-us/) published by Music Business Association in 2018, the visualization describes preferred music genres of 3000 U.S. consumers by age group. I was excited to work with this visualization because—as a drummer who enjoys playing several music genres—its data was immediately interesting. More importantly though, I was able to quickly identify areas of the viz. that I liked and disliked. This helped me build a strong [Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) (developed by Stephen Few), which guided my wireframing process and my eventual redesign.

#### The OG Viz
This is the original visualization that I chose to work on:
