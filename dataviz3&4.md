# Critique By Design

I wasn't specifically on the lookout for a music-related visualization, but when I stumbled upon one, I wasn't complaining! 
Pulled from a [study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253915/favorite-music-genres-in-the-us/) published by Music Business Association in 2018, the visualization describes preferred music genres of 3000 U.S. consumers by age group. I was excited to work with the visualization because—as a drummer who enjoys playing several music genres—its data was immediately interesting. More importantly though, I was able to quickly identify areas of the viz. that I liked and disliked. This helped me build a strong [Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) (developed by Stephen Few), which guided my wireframing process and my eventual redesign.

## The OG Viz
This is the original visualization that I chose to work on:

## Critiquing Cogently
After a good, prolonged look at the visualization, I recorded my general thoughts on it:

*"At first glance, the visualization looks interesting.*

*The colors are attractive. I especially like how the yellow and purple look towards the top of each stacked bar. The color wheel and its complementary colors substantiate why this may have been appealing. Beyond the scatter of colors that I immediately notice, I find myself being drawn to the chart because I’m a music enthusiast. I am in their target audience, and so I naturally want to learn more about how genres are perceived by different age groups. Perhaps, however, this may not be the case for everyone.* 

*Within seconds, there is a growing sense of feeling lost. While the visualization doesn’t feel jarring or irritating to look at, it still places too little consideration on the overall aesthetic appeal. The colors, percentages and legend all begin to swim around after a moment. I want to understand what numbers are being shown to me, but am unable to do it without some hard, focused searching. I feel like a visualization should make it easy for viewers to grasp interesting data, not hard. As a result, the information is interesting only for the short term—the short term being a couple of seconds. It doesn’t leave a lasting impression. I don’t feel like I learned something extraordinary. Perhaps, however, that is in part the topic’s fault, not solely the visualization’s. That is, the information doesn’t move me. I don’t find new purpose after viewing the chart. I don’t even feel compelled to simply share this information with more people.* 

*There are, however, things that I do like. I like that the visualization is credible and accurate. The study was conducted by Audiencenet and published by Music Business Association. It surveys favorite music genres of 3000 consumers in the United States as of July 2018, sorted by age group. This data is explained well in their provided Excel file, which also offers references and research methodology. This offers pretty good context, though the visualization doesn’t rely on it to be understandable – which is really great. The charts don’t show too much complex information. While this information is presented in a more complex way than needed, at least not a single element feels inscrutable. I also like that the goals of the visualization are clear, and the graph conveys exactly what it aims to. The visualization feels complete, apart from the fact that it does not include an “Other” response, raising the question: is every respondent’s answer represented or were some left out?* 

*If I could change a few things, I would begin with the colors. They bring out the notorious rainbow effect that we’ve frequently discussed in class. The percentages on the y-axis are also a little confusing; why do the numbers go beyond 300%? That takes a little more thinking, since it isn’t instantly intuitive. A final observation is that the comparisons between the age groups are unevenly distributed, so I would consider normalizing those as well."*
