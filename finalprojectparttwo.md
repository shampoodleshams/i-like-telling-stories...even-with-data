After completing Part I of my project, I developed a more refined storyboard to resurrect the dying perception towards horror movies today. A quick recap of the story structure I had outlined last week is below:
## Petrifying Project Structure
1. A brief background of horror movies 
2. The changing success of horror movies over the years
3. Consequences of creating/watching/curating poor horror movies - loss in monetary value, interest, time, energy, appreciation; rise in gimmicks, tropes, stereotypes
4. Research and exploratory data analysis
5. Insights and interesting analytics
6. Establishment of guidelines or recommendations as a CTA (call-to-action) for movie makers
7. Optimism for the future, crushing uncertainty
