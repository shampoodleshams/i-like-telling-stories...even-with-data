After completing Part I of my project, I developed a more refined storyboard to resurrect the dying perception towards horror movies today. A quick recap of the story structure I had outlined last week is below:

## Petrifying Project Structure
1. A brief background of horror movies 
2. The changing success of horror movies over the years
3. Consequences of creating/watching/curating poor horror movies - loss in monetary value, interest, time, energy, appreciation; rise in gimmicks, tropes, stereotypes
4. Research and exploratory data analysis
5. Insights and interesting analytics
6. Establishment of guidelines or recommendations as a CTA (call-to-action) for movie makers
7. Optimism for the future, crushing uncertainty

When I more carefully observed the datasets I had collected from my IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes sources, I realized that my story would reach its best potential if I also included relevant insights from well-researched qualitative stories related to horror psychology, phobias and cultural fears. 

A classmate from my critique team was very generous in sharing [this](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/08/candyman-why-horror-movies-are-the-future-1234660349/) article that adopts an optimistic view towards horror in cinema. She also shared how, through [this](https://screenrant.com/blumhouse-horror-movie-changes-small-budget-after-coronavirus/) article, major horror movie production companies may be planning to incorporate experimental, low-budget models in creating successful horror movies during the pandemic. These stories, while not comprehensively developed, have made me want to learn more about current sentiments of reviewers and horror movie creators. I think these pieces will help me better tell _my_ story.
