After completing Part I of my project, I developed a more refined storyboard to resurrect the alleged [dying perception](https://wheresthejump.com/has-the-quality-of-horror-movies-declined-over-time/) towards horror movies today. A quick recap of the story structure I had outlined last week is below:

## Petrifying Project Structure
1. A brief background of horror movies 
2. The changing success of horror movies over the years
3. Consequences of creating/watching/curating poor horror movies - loss in monetary value, interest, time, energy, appreciation; rise in gimmicks, tropes, stereotypes
4. Research and exploratory data analysis
5. Insights and interesting analytics
6. Establishment of guidelines or recommendations as a CTA (call-to-action) for movie makers
7. Optimism for the future, crushing uncertainty

## Nerve-racking New Reflections
When I more carefully observed the datasets I had collected from my IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes sources, I realized that my story would reach its best potential if I also included relevant insights from well-researched qualitative stories related to horror psychology, phobias and cultural fears. 

Malcolm Turvey, professor of Film Studies at Tufts University who has frequently taught the course "The Horror Film", digs into questions about why some people like horror movies. He [states](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/why-do-we-horror-movies), "“Horror is a genre that people tend to look down upon and not take very seriously. It has a reputation of being a low, somewhat trashy, titillating genre that appeals to our basest instincts. But it’s a wonderful, popular art form through which very complex ideas and creative techniques can manifest themselves—and if you can get past that very cliched view, you realize there’s an embarrassment of riches in the genre.”

Even in just those few words, he captures two very compelling ideas about horror as a genre: 
1. The emotion it teases out, fear, is one of our [six basic emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201601/what-are-basic-emotions)
2. It allows movie makers to seriously exploit their creative liberties and explore new possibilities 

While these may seem like rather simple ideas, they are important to my project. They suggest that fear is innate, universally understood and a primary emotion. They also suggest that oppportunities to experiment within the genre, like using symbolism and testing responses across time or culture, are aplenty. More importantly, perhaps these can be implemented in horror movies with relatively lower risk than in movies based in realism, science or history.

Additionally, a classmate from my critique team was very generous in sharing [this](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/08/candyman-why-horror-movies-are-the-future-1234660349/) article that adopts an optimistic view towards horror in cinema. She also shared how, through [this](https://screenrant.com/blumhouse-horror-movie-changes-small-budget-after-coronavirus/) article, major horror movie production companies may be planning to incorporate experimental, low-budget models in creating successful horror movies during the pandemic. These stories, while not comprehensively developed, have made me want to learn more about current sentiments of reviewers and horror movie creators. I think these pieces will help me better tell _my_ story.

## Witchy Wireframes and a Spine-tingling Storyboard
My final project and presentation will flow in the following way:

## Unearthly User Research Protocol and Intimidating Interviews
a. Target audiences: horror movie creators, movie creators and horror movie buffs

b. Approach: peers and family members who may not be randomly-selected, but will still represent a sufficiently-random distribution of individuals who may like or dislike, know or not know about, and be curious or disinterested by, horror movies

c. Interview script: 
1. On a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in horror movies? (before showing any wireframes)
2. Who do you think this research is intended for? (this and the following question is after showing the wireframes)
3. How did you feel in going through these wireframes?
4. Which chart did you find the most interesting and why?
5. Can you identify 3 things that you would like more clarity on?
6. Is there anything else you would like to have seen but did not see here?
7. On a scale of 1-10 now, how interested are you in horror movies?
8. Open discussion, last thoughts, any questions

d. Findings
#### Person 1: Graduate student of Tufts University (Master of Science in Economics), now working at a startup in North Carolina
1. 100+
2. Horror movie fans and possibly directors/producers
3. Very interested. The colors and kinds of stats, and even just the topic itself... really incredible
4. Actually found the call-out statistics more interesting
5. Which years are you looking at? Which countries?
6. No, this is all really cool
7. Still 100+


#### Person 2: MYP Coordinator at an international school in Mumbai
1. 2
2. People who enjoy watching horror movies
3. It was interesting. You've put in a good amount of thinking into this.
4. The pie chart, because these are apparently very real and common fears... and I'm not afraid of any of these
5. I think everything was clear, but who do you think will find this most interesting?
6. Some ideas given by people like Vikram Bhatt or Ram Gopal Verma
7. 2.5

#### Person 3: Fellow student at Carnegie Mellon University (Master of Information Systems Management)
1. 0
2. Directors or script-writers of horror movies
3. This was overall very interesting. I liked the non-policy feel of this project, it's really unique
4. The pie chart and the recommender boxes in the end
5. How confident can the audience be that your recommendations will lead to success? 
6. Can you add more percentages like you did within the first box in the other recommendations? Maybe you can add more boxes too... the first part of the story was really cool where you spoke a lot more about culture-specific things too
7. 0

e. Changes
<br>
In hindsight, I realized I needed to include ideas that were a lot more measurable in the recommendations towards the end. The statistics seemed to work for my CMU peer, who thought it would be beneficial to provide credibility to the recommendations. I will also consider adding more substantiation about the years looked at, the countries from which these movies originated, the streaming platform they're available on, the original language of the movies, and the languages the movies are available in. Most of the wireframes for the charts seemed quite intuitive to the three users. I might consider playing around with the colors a little more, and refining the language of the story to make it concise, interesting and actionable.

## Malicious Moodboards
When developing my moodboards, I tried to go for colors that strayed away from typical horror-movie-poster colors like black, red, harsh navy blues and dark greens. I did this because I felt like non-horror movie enthusiasts, or worse, people who actively dislike horror movies, shouldn't need an extra reason to associate my project with what they've been conditioned to feel through conventional horror movie posters. I thus chose to use my two favorite combinations of colors instead: blue and yellow, and pink and grey.

Here are two moodboard versions for my final story:

#### Vile Version 1
<img width="601" alt="moodboard 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78868693/136116182-98cef609-b18d-4a52-90ba-a67aa51184ff.png">
<br>
In this one, I used more organic elements, colors and innate fears (such as common fears of deep water, insects, dark forests, masked faces and megalophobic structures) 

#### Vicious Version 2
<img width="597" alt="moodboard 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78868693/136116124-b1973130-1de1-42d7-85e8-055366170ad6.png">
<br>
In this one, I used more man-made objects, old-school Japanese horror elements and unnatural tones (shades of uncomfortable pink, grey, and dark shadows).

#### The Dreadful Decision
I set up an Instagram poll to find out which one people generally liked more, and the results are below:

![Screenshot_20211005-230147__01__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78868693/136134133-a31aa549-9f86-4280-8a59-e46bc7962ce6.jpg)

However, based on my in-person interactions with my peers in class and a video call with two family members, the first one won by a larger margin. I will consider working with a color palette and visual scheme that more closely follows the first moodboard!
