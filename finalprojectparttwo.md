After completing Part I of my project, I developed a more refined storyboard to resurrect the alleged [dying perception](https://wheresthejump.com/has-the-quality-of-horror-movies-declined-over-time/) towards horror movies today. A quick recap of the story structure I had outlined last week is below:

## Petrifying Project Structure
1. A brief background of horror movies 
2. The changing success of horror movies over the years
3. Consequences of creating/watching/curating poor horror movies - loss in monetary value, interest, time, energy, appreciation; rise in gimmicks, tropes, stereotypes
4. Research and exploratory data analysis
5. Insights and interesting analytics
6. Establishment of guidelines or recommendations as a CTA (call-to-action) for movie makers
7. Optimism for the future, crushing uncertainty

## Nerve-racking New Reflections
When I more carefully observed the datasets I had collected from my IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes sources, I realized that my story would reach its best potential if I also included relevant insights from well-researched qualitative stories related to horror psychology, phobias and cultural fears. 

Malcolm Turvey, professor of Film Studies at Tufts University who has frequently taught the course "The Horror Film", digs into questions about why some people like horror movies. He [states](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/why-do-we-horror-movies), "“Horror is a genre that people tend to look down upon and not take very seriously. It has a reputation of being a low, somewhat trashy, titillating genre that appeals to our basest instincts. But it’s a wonderful, popular art form through which very complex ideas and creative techniques can manifest themselves—and if you can get past that very cliched view, you realize there’s an embarrassment of riches in the genre.”

Even in just those few words, he captures two very compelling ideas about horror as a genre: 
1. The emotion it teases out, fear, is one of our [six basic emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201601/what-are-basic-emotions)
2. It allows movie makers to seriously exploit their creative liberties and explore new possibilities 

While these may seem like rather simple ideas, they are important to my project. They suggest that fear is innate, universally understood and a primary emotion. They also suggest that oppportunities to experiment within the genre, like using symbolism and testing responses across time or culture, are aplenty. More importantly, perhaps these can be implemented in horror movies with relatively lower risk than in movies based in realism, science or history.

Additionally, a classmate from my critique team was very generous in sharing [this](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/08/candyman-why-horror-movies-are-the-future-1234660349/) article that adopts an optimistic view towards horror in cinema. She also shared how, through [this](https://screenrant.com/blumhouse-horror-movie-changes-small-budget-after-coronavirus/) article, major horror movie production companies may be planning to incorporate experimental, low-budget models in creating successful horror movies during the pandemic. These stories, while not comprehensively developed, have made me want to learn more about current sentiments of reviewers and horror movie creators. I think these pieces will help me better tell _my_ story.

## Witchy Wireframes and a Spine-tingling Storyboard
My final project and presentation will flow in the following way:

## Unearthly User Research and Intimidating Interviews
You should have also developed a simple user research protocol that describes what you hope to find during your user interviews, including your research questions and the script.  Once your interviews are complete, you should have documented findings that detail what you've learned by showing your early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.  

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 

## Malicious Moodboards
When developing my moodboards, I tried to go for colors that strayed away from typical horror-movie-poster colors like black, red, harsh navy blues and dark greens. I did this because I felt like non-horror movie enthusiasts, or worse, people who actively dislike horror movies, shouldn't need an extra reason to associate my project with what they've been conditioned to feel through conventional horror movie posters. I thus chose to use my two favorite combinations of colors instead: blue and yellow, and pink and grey.

Here are two moodboard versions for my final story:

#### Vile Version 1

In this one, I used more organic elements, colors and innate fears (such as common fears of deep water, insects, dark forests, masked faces and megalophobic structures) 

#### Vicious Version 2

In this one, I used more man-made objects, old-school Japanese horror elements and unnatural tones (shades of uncomfortable pink, grey, and dark shadows).

I set up an Instagram poll to find out which one people generally liked more, and the results are below:

Therefore, based on user feedback, the first one is more successful.
