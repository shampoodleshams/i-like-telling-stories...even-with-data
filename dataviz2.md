##### Source: [OECD Data](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)
The following bar chart displays general government debt as a percentage of GDP of 34 OECD countries in 2019. The dataset was obtained from OECD Data, a virtual host for international data about economics, health and education.

# Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio between 1995 and 2019
This visualization is a grid of line charts that represents the debt-to-GDP ratio of 35 OECD countries. The modified sparklines capture changes in this ratio over a span of 24 years, from 1995 to 2019. The visualization's simplicity might help the viewer note interesting differences between countries' ratios. For example, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio more than doubled between 1996 and 2009, while Estonia's remained consistently low through the years.

# Debt-to-GDP Ratio of the Axis Powers between 1995 and 2019
Of the 35 countries whose data was available on OECD's website, I was interested in those that became the Axis Powers during the second world war. Japan, Germany and Italy were the three main nations to sign the Tripartite Pact in September of 1940. Hungary signed the agreement two months later, making it the fourth nation to join the original Axis Powers. 

Of the four countries, Germany and Hungary had a relatively lower and more stable debt-to-GDP ratio between 1995 and 2019, whereas Japan saw a significant increase in the ratio over time. Italy maintained a high debt-to-GDP ratio but not as high as Japan's. In fact, while overall consistent in their ratio, Italy even saw slight dips in 2008, 2011 and 2018.
