### Reflections
I really enjoyed refining my project from Part II to get my most updated final project story. I performed three main tasks:
1. Create digital versions of all my wireframes from Parts I and II.
2. Develop my final storyboard. 
3. Adapt user research results into my story.

To create digital versions of my wireframes from Parts I and II, I used a variety of different tools:
1. **Flourish**, to build my data-centered visualizations (scatter graph, bar charts and radial graph)
2. **Wordclouds**, a new tool to show proportions of word usage in a dataset
3. **Wix visualizations**, including repeater blocks, tables and illustrated video elements
A major challenge in translating my wireframes to digital versions was that I did not have the right kind of data to capture what I had in mind. Therefore, I had to tweak my wireframe ideas slightly to present a story that I _did_ see in my datasets instead. In addition, I added several new secondary sources to expand my project's scope beyond just quantitative statistics. This helped me explore mise-en-scène elements with lower constraints.

I decided to present my final story using Wix instead of Shorthand, which was a different plan from the one I had stated in Part II. Although this was a relatively late decision during my project, I felt increasingly attracted by the idea and gave in eventually. Wix allowed me to experiment with many more visual elements such as video, transitions, animations, sizing and colors. Furthermore, my moving imagery (creepy crawlies, ocean waves, etc.) were obtained for free and without any property restrictions on Wix. This truly helped me take more visual risks with my final story and take as many creative liberties as appropriate!

As I built my story, I incorporated several suggestions I had gathered through my user research interviews last week. In particular, I added richer data context, explained my visualizations in more detail as opposed to leave them for the viewer to make sense of, and followed the visual scheme of my more popular moodboard from last week. The colors in the moodboard included deep blue-greens, heavy earthy colors like brown and orange, and spooky organism-born elements like eyeballs and insects. Since my intended audience for this story was horror movie creators and enthusiasts, I tried to address some of their potential questions in my head while building the story. This helped me recognize and redress components that felt vague, or ones that could result in confusion to the average audience. I also took extra care to not make my story too niche or inaccessible. The non-typical horror colors blue and yellow, the sans serif text, and the easy-to-understand visual elements helped me make my story more relatable.
