## Outrageously-Ghoulish Outline
Data trends in the movie industry such as [this one](https://wheresthejump.com/has-the-quality-of-horror-movies-declined-over-time/) suggest that the general positive perception towards horror movies in the past five decades might, on average, be dwindling. This can be attributed to a variety of factors: declining popularity, worsening quality, growing fear tolerance (or diminishing fear tolerance!), structural shift in budgets, biases in movie-recommender engines, fear exposure, ... _the list is endless_. 

Having watched over 150 horror movies from more than 4 continents and of at least 5 different languages, I am determined to see horror be reestablished as a successful genre in the international movie industry. I hope horror movie enthusiasts and new fans alike get to continue enjoying them for years to come. 

In this project, I will identify features of a horror movie that make it successsful. Because subjectively answering this project goal could make it vulnerable to ambiguities and complexity, I will define "success" more quantitatively. In particular, I will define horror movie success using the following potential metrics:

* Movie ratings that have been measured and recorded in a regularized way over the years (as a percentage)
* Box office collections (in US dollars, adjusting for inflation)
* Volume of international viewership
  
<br>Additionally, features of a horror movie could include quantifiable elements like:
* Length and pace
* Use and frequency of jump scares
* Premise (described in its synopsis)
* Age range of actors/characters (young kids? Babies? Old people? Family?)
* Central use of creatures, animals, insects to incite horror
* Central use of gore, weapons, trauma-inducing tools to incite horror
* Central use of psychological fears/phobias (agoraphobia, arachnophobia, thalassophobia) to incite horror

<br>The audience of my project might include horror movie creators and critics. They could say something like, "As a horror movie creator, I want to know what truly works for my audience so that I can create top-grossing, widely-reviewed, impactful horror movies while I'm alive," and, through my story, be able to identify specific fear triggers, movie attributes and psychological elements to adopt in their next feature films.

## Petrifying Project Structure
1. A brief background of horror movies 
2. The changing success of horror movies over the years
3. Consequences of creating/watching/curating poor horror movies - loss in monetary value, interest, time, energy, appreciation; rise in gimmicks, tropes, stereotypes
4. Research and exploratory data analysis
5. Insights and interesting analytics
6. Establishment of guidelines or recommendations as a CTA (call-to-action) for movie makers
7. Optimism for the future, crushing uncertainty

## Spine-chilling Sketches
Here are two of my initial sketches based loosely on the project idea. The first is a story arc, and the second is a comic-style layout of my story:

#### Sinister Story Arc

#### Creepy Comic-Style Layout

After my initial sketches, I built a few more guided by the datasets and project outline:

## Devilishly Daunting Data
1. My primary data source will be this [IMDB Horror Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-horror-movie-dataset), which I have downloaded as a CSV file.
  This dataset includes key attributes like: title, genre, release date and country, movie rating, review rating, length, plot, cast, and language.

2. I will also consider using Rotten Tomatoes' [list](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_horror_movies/) of top 100 horror movies of all time.
  This is a compilation of the highest-ranking horror movies by year, adjusted for variation in the number of reviews. 

For establishing background context, I might consider fetching numbers from credible statistical wesbites or studies. The above data sources will be used primarily for the investigation component of my project. While several attributes provided in the datasets are useful, I foresee identifying additional features myself. These include components listed under Outrageously-Ghoulish Outline and Spine-chilling Sketches. Along the way, if I come across additional helpful sources, I will reference them in my project where required. As shown in my sketches, effective data visualizations for exploratory data analysis could include:

1. Bar charts
2. Bubble charts
3. Sparklines
4. Pie charts
5. Simple tables
6. Area charts (along time)
7. Pictograms

## Menacing Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand for the final rendition of my story. The single-page view and ease of using it will give my entire story a better flow than something like PowerPoint slides. I hope to use interactive charts, attractive type and font, and rich multimedia content like images, simple transitions or even short videos. A general timeline for my project's completion is shown below.

#### Phantom-like Phases
1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Development of Shorthand page with new visualizations
4. Refining of story using text, color theory, story arc and references
5. Test with one or two people, gather feedback
6. Step 4, as many times as needed
7. Finalize

#### Frightening Final Thoughts
While telling a compelling story with the data, I will also consider writing up a section on limitations. I think this project is inherently biased in the features I choose to highlight, the years and regions I look at, and the assumption that any recommendations I make will hold significant value indefinitely. The scope of my project is also quite wide, but I have simplified it based on the most obvious, quantifiable elements in any horror movie. Therefore, cultural nuances, language, historical significance and artistic liberties of the movie may not be well-recognized. A way to overcome this challenge could be to focus movie selections to only one region (the US) and a specified time period. Finally, this project assumes that, all other things held constant, an improvement in the identified elements for future horror movies might increase their success. However, in the real world, a horror movie's success will be attributed to several other factors as identified in the beginning of this assignment. Common themes and occurrences of any identified elements may also only be correlated with, not a cause of, success.
