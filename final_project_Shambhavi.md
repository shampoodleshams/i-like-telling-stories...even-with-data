# The Hopeful Healing of Horror 
# _Final Project - Part I_

## Outline
Data trends in the movie industry such as [this one](https://wheresthejump.com/has-the-quality-of-horror-movies-declined-over-time/) suggest that the general perception towards horror movies in the past five decades might, on average, be dwindling. This can be attributed to a variety of factors: declining popularity, worsening quality, growing fear tolerance (or diminishing fear tolerance!), structural shift in budgets, biases in movie-recommender engines, fear exposure, ... _the list is endless_. 

Having watched over 150 horror movies from more than 4 continents and of at least 5 different languages, I am determined to see horror be reestablished as a successful genre in the international movie industry. I hope horror movie enthusiasts and new fans alike get to continue enjoying them for years to come. 

In this project, I will identify features of a horror movie that make it successsful. Because subjectively answering this project goal could make it vulnerable to ambiguities and complexity, I will define "success" more quantitatively. In particular, I will define horror movie success using the following potential metrics:

<li> Movie ratings that have been measured and recorded in a regularized way over the years (as a percentage)
<li> Box office collections (in US dollars, adjusting for inflation)
<li> Volume of international viewership 
  
Additionally, features of a horror movie could include quantifiable elements like:
<li> Length and pace
<li> Use and frequency of jump scares
<li> Premise (described in its synopsis)
<li> Age range of actors/characters (young kids? Babies? Old people? Family?)
<li> Central use of creatures, animals, insects to incite horror
<li> Central use of gore, weapons, trauma-inducing tools
<li> Central use of psychological fears/phobias (agoraphobia, arachnophobia, thalassophobia) </li>

## Project Structure

<li> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  

## Initial Sketches
We've begun to explore how sketching can be a great way to help solidify your ideas into design choices, and for your proposal you'll be creating sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project.  You may choose to present your sketches and integrate them into Part I of your final project in whatever fashion you feel makes the most sense - but they should be clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background for your project.  Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate and you may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.).   Show both your anticipated data visualizations as well as major elements of your story itself (e.g key headers, etc.)

## The Data
It's important that you identify your primary data source.  To be successful in the final project, you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, or recreate it based on various sources.  Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

<li> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
<li> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

## Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 

Finally, for your final project presentation I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project presentation (a pitch deck) that's ok - but your Powerpoint slides alone are not sufficient in meeting the requirements of the final project deliverable.  Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.
