Welcome to my portfolio for Telling Stories With Data at CMU! ‚≠êüå≥

Here, you'll find me applying both parts of my brain! Left for logic, rigor, the science behind my storytelling, and right for creativity, intuition, the emotional depth in my visualizations. Thanks for stopping by!

# About Me 
My name is Shambhavi (pronounced Shaaaambh-uh-vee) and I go by she/her pronouns. I'm inching my way towards graduating from CMU with my Master of Information Systems Management, and I'm excited for what might come after! 

I really come alive when I get the chance to solve problems using creative methods. In the last 5 years, I studied Mathematics and Studio Art and then went on to work as marketing specialist at a nonprofit, through which I learned how to tell the agency's story better using data. It's what led me to pursue my current track- and this course. A strange fun fact about me is that I love flight food. 

# What I Hope to Learn
## My short answer:
How design and science can blend together to tell compelling stories, answer pressing questions, uncover mysterious secrets of the world and topple baseless myths. 

## My longer answer:
I think this course will help me find enjoyment in brainstorming data viz. solutions, something that might look deceptively simple. But just like writing poetry or painting a dog portrait, I think there are many hidden complexities in making a successful visualization. The practice is driven by intuition, logic, empathy, a lot of trial and error... and the occasional grumble of frustration. It must be a non-linear process, going back and forth between stages of iteration and visualization rendering, with the hope that a new version turns out better than a current version. Or that something beautiful emerges from a really tangled, clunky, muddy dataset. And I want to find out if there ever is an end point to this process‚Äî or if at some point, I'll just put my foot down and say, ‚Äúthis is the best I could come up with.‚Äù

I hope the learnings from this class will remain with me indefinitely. Eventually, I want to join an organization that is committed to building well-being in the community: either through data solutions, creative services or innovative digital products.
